Seamless Multi-API Translation: Simplifying Language Barriers with universal translation provider support.

EasyTL provides a simple and consistent interface for translating text across multiple translation APIs. üîÑüî§ It offers a range of features to customize the translation process, manage costs, and validate credentials before submitting requests. ‚öôÔ∏èüí∞‚úîÔ∏è

Currently it supports **Anthropic, Azure Translation Service, DeepL, Gemini, Google Translate, and OpenAI**. ü§ñüíª To request new services, please open an issue on the GitHub repository or contact Bikatr7@proton.me or alemalvarez@icloud.com. üì©‚úâÔ∏è

EasyTL has a Trello board for tracking planned features and issues: üìãüóÇÔ∏è

**Quick Start**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get started with EasyTL, install the package via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install easytl

Then, you can translate text using by importing the global client.

For example, with DeepL:

.. code-block:: python

   from easytl import EasyTL

   ## Set your API key
   EasyTL.set_credentials("deepl", "your_api_key_here")

   ## You can also validate your API keys; translation functions will do this automatically
   is_valid, e = EasyTL.validate_credentials("deepl")

   translated_text = EasyTL.deepl_translate("ÁßÅ„ÅØÊó•Êú¨Ë™û„ÅåË©±„Åõ„Åæ„Åô", "EN-US") ## Text to translate, language to translate to, only two "required" arguments but there are more optional arguments for additional functionality and other services.

**Features**
------------

EasyTL offers seamless integration with several translation APIs, allowing users to easily switch between services based on their needs. Key features include:

- Support for multiple translation APIs including OpenAI, DeepL, Gemini, and Google Translate.
- Simple API key and credential management.
- Methods to validate credentials before usage.
- Cost estimation tools to help manage usage based on text length, translation instructions for LLMs, and translation services.
- Highly customizable translation options, with the API's original features.
- Lots of optional arguments for additional functionality. Such as decorators, semaphores, and rate-limit delays.

**API Usage**
-------------

Translating Text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use `deepl_translate`, `googletl_translate`, `openai_translate`, or `gemini_translate` to translate text using the respective services. Each method accepts various parameters to customize the translation process, such as language, text format, and API-specific features like formality level or temperature for creative outputs.

All services offer asynchronous translation methods that return a future object for concurrent processing. These methods are suffixed with `_async` and can be awaited to retrieve the translated text.

Instead of receiving the translated text directly, you can also use the `response` parameter to get the full response object from the API.

Generic Translation Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EasyTL has generic translation methods `translate` and `translate_async` that can be used to translate text with any of the supported services. These methods accept the text, service, and kwargs of the respective service as parameters.

Cost Calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `calculate_cost` method provides an estimate of the cost associated with translating a given text with specified settings for each supported service.

characters or tokens depending on the service.

.. code-block:: python

   num_characters, cost, model = EasyTL.calculate_cost("This has a lot of characters", "deepl")

or

.. code-block:: python

   num_tokens, cost, model = EasyTL.calculate_cost("This has a lot of tokens.", "openai", model="gpt-4", translation_instructions="Translate this text to Japanese.")

Credentials Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Credentials can be set and validated using `set_credentials` and `validate_credentials` methods to ensure they are active and correct before submitting translation requests.

**Notes**
---------

EasyTL was originally developed as a part of `Kudasai <https://github.com/Bikatr7/Kudasai>`_, a Japanese preprocessor later turned Machine Translator. It was later split off into its own package to be used independently of Kudasai for multiple reasons.

This package is also my second serious attempt at creating a Python package, so I'm sure there are some things that could be improved. Feedback is welcomed.
